# modal-window-classlists

A very tiny modal window project. This was just to practice DOM manipulation and familiarize myself with classlists.
Conditions include opening and closing each modal window with a click. When a modal window is opened, a gradiant appears in
the background. The modal window can be closed either by clicking the "x" icon, clicking anywhere on the page outside of the modal window, or by pressing the escape key on your keyboard.
